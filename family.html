		<p>The youngest child, and only son, of Galynn and Tom Brady. The Bradys were a close-knit family, and they were all sports enthusiasts. The three Brady girls (Maureen, Nancy, and Julie) played every sport imaginable, including softball, soccer, and basketball. Tommy, as his family calls him, always went to their games and cheered them on. He also caught their competitive spirit.Tom Brady has three children. His first child is John "Jack" Edward Brady whom he had with his ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan. The two dated for three years from 2004 to 2006. That same year, Brady started dating Bündchen. A few months into their relationship Moynahan announced that she was pregnant with Brady’s baby. Jack was born in 2007 and Bündchen has raised him as her own. She told Parade magazine “I want him to have a great relationship with his mom, because that’s important, but I love him the same way as if he were mine. I already feel like he’s my son, from the first day.” </p>
